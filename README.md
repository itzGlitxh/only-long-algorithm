# Trend-Catcher [15m]

## Overview
Trend-Catcher [15m] is an advanced trading algorithm designed for dynamic market conditions. It uses trend analysis to execute both long and short trades based on the Radius Trend indicator and the Stochastic Oscillator.

## Indicators Used
- **Radius Trend**: Determines market trend direction and adjusts trading bands dynamically.
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: Identifies overbought and oversold conditions for precise entry and exit points.

## Execution Logic
- **Entry Conditions**:
  - Long Entry: Triggered when the Stochastic Oscillator indicates oversold conditions and the Radius Trend suggests a potential upward reversal.
  - Re-Entry: If the trend remains bullish after a stop-loss trigger, re-entry occurs based on recalibrated support levels.

- **Exit Conditions**:
  - Profit Target: Trades close at a pre-defined profit percentage.
  - Stop Loss: Stops are adjusted based on dynamic support and resistance levels.

- **Trade Management**:
  - Adjusts trade size, stop loss, and take profit dynamically based on market volatility.
  - Implements Sharpe Ratio tracking for performance evaluation.

## Features
